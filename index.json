C++ is a general-purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of the C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a \u0026ldquo;C style\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;object-oriented style.\u0026rdquo; In certain scenarios, it can be coded in either way and is thus an effective example of a hybrid language.\nC++ is considered to be an intermediate-level language, as it encapsulates both high- and low-level language features. Initially, the language was called \u0026ldquo;C with classes\u0026rdquo; as it had all the properties of the C language with an additional concept of \u0026ldquo;classes.\u0026rdquo; However, it was renamed C++ in 1983.\nIt is pronounced \u0026ldquo;see-plus-plus.\u0026rdquo;\n","permalink":"https://walimcode.github.io/blog/post-10/","tags":["Photos","Game","HTML","Python","New"],"title":"C++"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Your child’s first coding kit ","permalink":"https://walimcode.github.io/blog/post-5/","tags":["Photos","HTML","Python","New"],"title":"Child's Coding Kit"},{"categories":null,"contents":"MCU Robots With a profound background of STEAM education, Walimaker provides innovative educational robots that enables students to create, program, with collaborative STEAM activities, Walimaker helps students learn core-subjects and develop 21st-century skills like problem-solving, critical-thinking, and collaboration in a fun and engaging way.\n","permalink":"https://walimcode.github.io/blog/post-12/","tags":["Game","HTML","Python","New"],"title":"Coding Robots for Kids"},{"categories":["Android And Gmaing"],"contents":"You\u0026rsquo;re here because you want the best And we know it ","permalink":"https://walimcode.github.io/blog/post-1/","tags":["Photos","Game","React","Python","New"],"title":"Learning Empowers Your Future"},{"categories":["Web Design"],"contents":"You\u0026rsquo;re here because you want the best And we know it ","permalink":"https://walimcode.github.io/blog/post-3/","tags":["Photos","Game","React","Python","New"],"title":"Learning Empowers Your Future"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Machine Vision with Python The OpenMV project is about creating low-cost, extensible, Python powered, machine vision modules and aims at becoming the “Arduino of Machine Vision“.

During the WALIMAKER class, you\u0026rsquo;ll discover the essentials of Python, including how to use Python\u0026rsquo;s extensive standard library, the difference between strings and lists, and using for-loops and while-loops. By the end of the book, readers have built a couple of games and created drawings with Python\u0026rsquo;s graphics library, Tkinter. Each chapter closes with fun and relevant exercises that challenge the reader to put their newly acquired knowledge to the test.\nKids are always the most fast-paced and enthusiastic learners, and are naturally willing to build stuff that looks like magic at the end (when it works!). Programming can be one such magic. Being able to write a program that works helps them feel they\u0026rsquo;ve really achieved something. Kids today are very tech-savvy and cannot wait to enter the fast-paced digital world.\nBecause Python is one of the most popular languages and has a syntax that is quite simple to understand, even kids are eager to use it as a stepping stone to learning programming languages.\nWhat Is Python Programming Language? Python is an interpreted language. This means that it is not converted to computer-readable code before the program is run but at runtime. In the past, this type of language was called a scripting language, intimating its use was for trivial tasks. However, programming languages such as Python have forced a change in that nomenclature.
